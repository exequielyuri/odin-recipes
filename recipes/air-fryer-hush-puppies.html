        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Forget about deep frying, and give your hush puppies a light update using an air fryer. They're just a bit denser in texture than deep frying, and look for a subtle hint of heat. They're the perfect sidekick to fried fish or shrimp, but they're equally good with a drizzle of honey.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cooking Spray</b> [nonfat]</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Line the bottom of the air fryer basket with aluminum foil and spray with nonfat cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Stir cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne, and garlic powder together in a large bowl. Mix in onion and bell pepper.</li>

                <li>Drop cornmeal mixture into the foil-lined basket using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, making sure not to have them touching each other. Coat with nonfat cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until golden brown, crispy, and cooked through, 9 to 10 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
